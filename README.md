🛠 Common Errors & Fixes
1. NameError: name 'CrewBase' is not defined

CrewAI >=0.186.0 removed CrewBase.

Fix: Remove @CrewBase, just use class StockPicker:.

2. Failed Search the internet with Serper

Usually caused by invalid API key or queries too strict.

Fix:

Ensure $SERPER_API_KEY is set.

Loosen task prompt:
Find trending companies in the {sector} sector on the NGX OR covered in Nigerian financial news.

3. exchange placeholder not working

We removed {exchange} and hardcoded NGX in agents.yaml and tasks.yaml.

Fix: Remove "exchange": "NGX" from main.py inputs. Only pass "sector".

4. EntityMemory or ShortTermMemory errors

OpenAI embeddings (text-embedding-3-small) not wanted.

Fix: In crew.py set:
short_term_memory=None
entity_memory=None


5. Missing output/ folder

Fix: Already handled in main.py:
os.makedirs("output", exist_ok=True)

6. Wrong companies (e.g. Apple/Tesla)

Caused by Serper pulling foreign stocks.

Fix:

Hardcode NGX in prompts.

Validate results against a local ngx_tickers.json.
