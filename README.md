üõ† Common Errors & Fixes
1. NameError: name 'CrewBase' is not defined

CrewAI >=0.186.0 removed CrewBase.

Fix: Remove @CrewBase, just use class StockPicker:.

2. Failed Search the internet with Serper

Usually caused by invalid API key or queries too strict.

Fix:

Ensure $SERPER_API_KEY is set.

Loosen task prompt:
Find trending companies in the {sector} sector on the NGX OR covered in Nigerian financial news.

3. exchange placeholder not working

We removed {exchange} and hardcoded NGX in agents.yaml and tasks.yaml.

Fix: Remove "exchange": "NGX" from main.py inputs. Only pass "sector".

4. EntityMemory or ShortTermMemory errors

OpenAI embeddings (text-embedding-3-small) not wanted.

Fix: In crew.py set:
short_term_memory=None
entity_memory=None


5. Missing output/ folder

Fix: Already handled in main.py:
os.makedirs("output", exist_ok=True)

6. Wrong companies (e.g. Apple/Tesla)

Caused by Serper pulling foreign stocks.

Fix:

Hardcode NGX in prompts.

Validate results against a local ngx_tickers.json.

{
  "chosen_company": {
    "name": "MTN Nigeria",
    "rationale": "MTN Nigeria is the largest telecommunications operator in Nigeria..."
  },
  "not_selected_companies": [
    { "name": "Jumia", "reason": "Volatility and competition" },
    { "name": "Globacom", "reason": "Smaller scale vs MTN" }
  ]
}

üåç Roadmap

 Add NGX ticker validation step

 Add fallback to Nigerian news sites (BusinessDay, Nairametrics, NGXGroup)

 Support for multiple exchanges (future expansion)

 Better visualization of research reports
