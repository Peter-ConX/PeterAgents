Add print statements to understand what's going on, and then come up with your own variations.<br/><br/>If you have time, I'd love it if you submit a PR for changes in the community_contributions folder - instructions in the resources. Also, if you have a Github account, use this to showcase your variations.

       "\n",
       "### 1. **Identify the Ethical Dilemma**\n",
       "   - Clearly define the situation and outline the competing values (e.g., individual rights vs. the greater good).\n",
       "   - Determine all stakeholders involved and how they are affected by the dilemma.\n",
       "\n",
       "### 2. **Gather Relevant Facts**\n",
       "   - Collect all pertinent information, including context, potential consequences, and existing laws or regulations.\n",
       "   - Understand the perspectives of all stakeholders to appreciate the moral weight of each value.\n",
       "\n",
       "### 3. **Utilize Ethical Frameworks**\n",
       "   Several ethical frameworks can be applied to analyze the dilemma:\n",
       "\n",
       "   **a. Utilitarianism:**\n",
       "   - Assess the consequences of potential actions and evaluate which option maximizes overall happiness or minimizes harm.\n",
       "\n",
       "   **b. Deontological Ethics:**\n",
       "   - Focus on the moral principles and duties involved. Determine what rules or obligations are at stake, such as the duty to respect individuals' rights.\n",
       "\n",
       "   **c. Virtue Ethics:**\n",
       "   - Reflect on the character and virtues of the individuals involved. Consider what a virtuous person would do in this situation and how the action aligns with moral character.\n",
       "\n",
       "   **d. Rights-Based Ethics:**\n",
       "   - Examine the fundamental rights of individuals involved and consider whether these rights should be prioritized over collective goals.\n",
       "\n",
       "   **e. Care Ethics:**\n",
       "   - Emphasize relationships and the context of care, evaluating how decisions affect individuals affected by the dilemma, fostering empathy and connection.\n",
       "\n",
       "### 4. **Analyze the Options**\n",
       "   - Generate possible courses of action based on the previous frameworks.\n",
       "   - Evaluate each option against the competing values, considering the short-term and long-term effects on stakeholders.\n",
       "\n",
       "### 5. **Consider Legal and Social Norms**\n",
       "   - Examine relevant laws, regulations, and social norms that could influence the ethical decision-making process. Understand the legal implications and societal expectations surrounding the dilemma.\n",
       "\n",
       "### 6. **Make a Decision**\n",
       "   - Weigh the outcomes and ethical implications of each option.\n",
       "   - Choose the course of action that strikes a balance between individual rights and the greater good, while being mindful of the moral frameworks.\n",
       "\n",
       "### 7. **Reflect and Reassess**\n",
       "   - After action is taken, reflect on the decision's impact and gather feedback from affected stakeholders.\n",
       "   - Reassess the situation periodically to ensure that the decision remains justifiable as circumstances change.\n",
       "\n",
       "### 8. **Document the Process**\n",
       "   - Keep a record of the decision-making process, including the analysis of values and frameworks used, in order to provide transparency and accountability.\n",
       "\n",
       "By systematically applying these steps and frameworks, one can navigate ethical dilemmas with a comprehensive understanding and a balanced approach, addressing the needs of both individuals and the broader community."
